# Ark Re:Code Clothes Remover

A simple tool to mod [Ark Re:Code](https://www.arkrecode.com/landing_page_en.html#page1) bundles. Thanks to Danieru for the help.

When the girls in this game take damage their clothes change to two different states, and the final state is where they lose their clothes or almost all of their clothes. This tool swaps those states making the clothesless state to be the default one, that way the girls will be clothesless from the beginning and they will get the clothes back when they take damage.



## Requirements to use the scripts:

  - Download and install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe), and install the necessary dependencies following [this video](https://files.catbox.moe/vqsuix.mp4).
  - Double-click on `0_install_requirements.bat` to start the download and installation of the remaining requirements.



## Usage:

1. Go to your `Android` folder, go to `data` and find Ark Re:Code game folder (`com.nerversoft.ark.recode`).
2. Copy the `Caching` folder from your Android device to your PC.
3. Move that copied folder to the tool folder (`\data\com.nerversoft.ark.recode\files\`).
4. Double-click on _1__SWAP.bat_ and leave the tool to do its magic.
5. If everything worked as expected you can move the `Caching` folder with the modded files back to your Android device. 

NOTE: The JSON catalog is useful to know what folders contain the bundles corresponding to the characters.

Entries like `h001/img_6a55d92a838e1ee25b88dc3e985cc022` contain the portrait images of the character and their icons. The foldername is `6a55d92a838e1ee25b88dc3e985cc022`.
Entries like `h005_a70c6f31c96e49db90d1bfd03d716780` contain the character and their skill cutscenes. The foldername is `a70c6f31c96e49db90d1bfd03d716780`.


Happy modding! ^â€¿^
